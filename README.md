Accurate Fraudulent Transaction Detection is very important task for both safety-security and customer satisfaction

This project applied several supervised learning algorithms like: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Extra Trees, CatBoost, XGBoost and LightGBM as well as an unsupervised learning algorithm called Isolation Forest.
Other supervised learning algorithms like Support Vector Machine and TabNet were exempted beacuse of their extremely slow convergence.

The dataset is really big (6.35 million samples). So working with it gave me an idea of the limitations of pandas and local machines/hardwares
